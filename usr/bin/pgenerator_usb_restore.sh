#
# First-boot settings rescue. A re-flashed image carries
# /etc/BiasiLinux/BiasiLinux.FirstBoot until rcPGenerator consumes it,
# so this is the one moment we know the device is factory-fresh. If a
# USB stick written by the WebUI's "Backup to USB" button (which puts a
# .pgbackup AND a PGEN_USB_RESCUE sentinel on a blank stick) is plugged
# in, restore it before the daemon's first start: the user flashes the
# card, plugs the stick, powers on, and the box comes back with their
# settings, profiles and calibration history. Rescue is opt-in: a
# browser-downloaded .pgbackup copied onto a stick by hand carries no
# sentinel and is deliberately IGNORED here — an arbitrary stick must
# never push settings onto an unattended first boot.
#
# Safe by construction:
#  - no first-boot marker  -> exit (normal boot, never touch settings)
#  - no USB stick          -> exit
#  - no/invalid .pgbackup  -> exit; the helper validates the archive
#    (format, manifest, per-file sha256) BEFORE writing anything, and
#    a wrong-board or foreign archive can only fail validation.
#  - restore writes exactly the backup's file list, and the helper
#    takes a rollback snapshot under /var/lib/PGenerator/system-backups
#    before applying.
# A marker file records the attempt either way so exactly one rescue
# runs per flashed image; re-flashing restores the trigger.
#
# Called by rcPGenerator AFTER the disk resize and BEFORE the PGenerator
# daemon starts. Root. Logs to /tmp so the (ephemeral) log never
# outlives into a restored state; the durable trail is the rollback
# snapshot plus a one-line marker.
